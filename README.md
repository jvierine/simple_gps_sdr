# simple_gps_sdr

It seems like everyone who does radio signal processing will at some point venture into GNSS signal processing. This is my playground for playing with this topic. Nothing fancy to see here. 

First principles and barebones signal processing from raw voltage. Intended to act as a playground for GPS reflectometry and studies of ionospheric effects. For now, just L1 C/A code based. There are no plans to include navigation message decoding at this point. Maybe later...
